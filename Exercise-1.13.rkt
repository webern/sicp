"Excersize 1.13"

; Exercise 1.13: Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to φn/√5, where φ = (1 + √5)/2.
; Hint: Let ψ = (1 − √5)/2. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see Section 
; 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (φn − ψ n )/√5.

; TODO - this is math/hard come back to this.
