; Exercise 1.24: Modify the timed-prime-test procedure of Exercise 1.22 to use fast-prime? (the
; Fermat method), and test each of the 12 primes you found in that exercise. Since the Fermat test
; has Î˜(log n) growth, how would you expect the time to test primes near 1,000,000 to compare with
; the time needed to test primes near 1000? Do your data bear this out? Can you explain any
; discrepancy you find?

; Expected growth for each order of magniture is log2(10) => 3.3
; So we should expect a linear increase in time for each order-of-magnitude increase

; Conclusion: my machine is too fast to make meaningful observations on the time complexity of
; fast-prime. I think the runtime is probably dominated by the handling of massive integers.
